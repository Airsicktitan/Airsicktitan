# Hi, I’m Adam

Welcome to my GitHub profile. This is where I build, iterate, and refine software with a focus on real-world use cases and long-term maintainability.

## About Me
- Software engineer with **4+ years of hands-on SQL experience**, working daily with complex queries, reporting, and data analysis in production environments  
- Primary focus on **C# and .NET**, especially backend development and API design  
- Experience with **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **Go**, primarily for services, tooling, and experimentation  
- Strong interest in understanding system design, trade-offs, and architectural decisions rather than relying on surface-level implementations

## What I’m Working On
- Backend APIs using modern **.NET / Minimal APIs**
- Authentication and authorization (JWT, middleware pipelines, policies)
- Full-stack prototypes designed around real business constraints
- SaaS-style projects emphasizing:
  - Clear domain modeling
  - Maintainable and testable code
  - Practical, product-driven features

Most repositories here are intentionally iterative and reflect continuous learning, refactoring, and improvement.

## Currently Learning
- React for frontend development and API integration
- Next.js for modern full-stack workflows
- Advanced C# and .NET concepts, including middleware, request lifecycles, and application architecture

## Approach
- Preference for depth of understanding over copy-paste solutions
- Emphasis on clean design, clarity, and intentional code
- Continuous improvement through refactoring and review
